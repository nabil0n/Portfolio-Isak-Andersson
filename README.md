### Who am I?
After a career teaching piano I'm now looking to new horizons in IT, hopefully alongside my earlier ventures!

Outside of my professions I like to stay active as well as game a bunch, both at the table top as well as behind the screen. I freelance as a pianist and singer, and lend my voice to a couple choirs in town.

But in this repository I'll gather my IT-ventures and projects for your pleasure! From IT-start to IT-finish!
